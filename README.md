# SEED Reporter
A utility mod that can display information about a sector seed, like the location of Coronal Hypershunts and exceptional officer pods.

Also includes tools for seed-hunting, like a new game option that bypasses the time-pass step, automatically saving remarkable seeds into a file, and a AutoHotkey script to constantly create new games.

Requires the Console Commands mod to output the results in-game.
