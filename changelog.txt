Version 0.2.0

* Moved all SEED report config settings to seedreporterSettings.json (previously modSettings.json)
  - Renamed "planetsToSearch" to "planetFilters"
* Added custom exceptional officer search settings to seedreporterSettings.json
  - These allow searching for specific template combinations (e.g., 2 slow High Tech officers and 2 fast High Tech ones)
  - The SEED report will now save the seed if any of the template combinations in "exceptionalOfficerSearch" are found
  - By default, seeds with 4-of-a-kind exceptional officer combinations are saved to "seedreporter_savedSeeds.json"
  - Seeds with no exceptional officer pods are no longer saved to the seed file
* Modified the time-skip new game option to instead start with a Scarab and no additional officers
* Normalized coordinates to the hyperspace grid size to simplify searching for systems in the hyperspace map
