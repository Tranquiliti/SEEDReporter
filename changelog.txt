Version 0.3.0

* Added "runSEEDReportOnGameStart" setting to seedreporterSettings.json
  - Can be set to "false" to disable automatically running a report upon starting a new game
* Added LunaLib setting support for "runSEEDReportOnGameStart"
* Fixed exceptional officer search not correctly handling combinations containing at least two different templates
* Renamed "distanceFromCore" to "distanceFromCOM"
  - Now uses the market center of mass calculation (instead of a hard-coded value) to determine distance



Version 0.2.0

* Moved all SEED report config settings to seedreporterSettings.json (previously modSettings.json)
  - Renamed "planetsToSearch" to "planetFilters"
* Added custom exceptional officer search settings to seedreporterSettings.json
  - These allow searching for specific template combinations (e.g., 2 slow High Tech officers and 2 fast High Tech ones)
  - The SEED report will now save the seed if any of the template combinations in "exceptionalOfficerSearch" are found
  - By default, seeds with 4-of-a-kind exceptional officer combinations are saved to "seedreporter_savedSeeds.json"
  - Seeds with no exceptional officer pods are no longer saved to the seed file
* Modified the time-skip new game option to instead start with a Scarab and no additional officers
* Normalized coordinates to the hyperspace grid size to simplify searching for systems in the hyperspace map
