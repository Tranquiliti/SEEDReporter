Version 0.3.0

* Overhauled the layout of the SEED report output
* Replaced the hard-coded system search with the "starSystemFilters" setting in seedreporterSettings.json
  - Allows searching for star systems that fit a certain criteria
* Added "tesseractStarSystemFilter" setting
  - Specifies which star system filter to use when searching for Tesseracts (should the Coronal Hypershunt filter be modified)
* Replaced "saveSeedIfFound" option with "saveShorthand"
  - "saveShorthand" enables configuring the filter's shorthand when printing the seed
  - Having a filter (either planet or system) with a specified "saveShorthand" now saves the seed if a planet/system passes the filter
* Added "avoidSystemTags" option for "planetFilters"
  - Replaces the hard-coded system tag filter for planets
* Replaced "inGateSystem", "inDomainCryosleeperRange", and "inCoronalHypershuntRange" options with "inStarSystemFilters"
  - Allows searching for planets that are also either inside or near a filtered star system
* Added "runSEEDReportOnGameStart" setting to seedreporterSettings.json
  - Can be set to "false" to disable automatically running a report upon starting a new game
* Added LunaLib setting support
  - Only "runSEEDReportOnGameStart" is supported at this time
* Fixed exceptional officer search not correctly handling combinations containing at least two different templates
* Renamed "distanceFromCore" option to "distanceFromCOM"
  - Now uses the market center of mass calculation (instead of a hard-coded value) to determine distance
* Significant code refactors



Version 0.2.0

* Moved all SEED report config settings to seedreporterSettings.json (previously modSettings.json)
  - Renamed "planetsToSearch" to "planetFilters"
* Added custom exceptional officer search settings to seedreporterSettings.json
  - These allow searching for specific template combinations (e.g., 2 slow High Tech officers and 2 fast High Tech ones)
  - The SEED report will now save the seed if any of the template combinations in "exceptionalOfficerSearch" are found
  - By default, seeds with 4-of-a-kind exceptional officer combinations are saved to "seedreporter_savedSeeds.json"
  - Seeds with no exceptional officer pods are no longer saved to the seed file
* Modified the time-skip new game option to instead start with a Scarab and no additional officers
* Normalized coordinates to the hyperspace grid size to simplify searching for systems in the hyperspace map



Version 0.1.0

* Initial release
